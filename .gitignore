# Application settings (often contain sensitive data or local overrides)
# It's good practice to version appsettings.json for default values,
# but ignore local development overrides or secrets.
# If you are using User Secrets, you should not version appsettings.Development.json either.
# For production, secrets should be managed via environment variables or a secret store.
# I'm commenting these out assuming you might want appsettings.json to be versioned for default values.
# If these contain sensitive data for ALL environments, consider not versioning them or using secrets.
